# Eats Flies Dont Dies
 
This is a game I made in 72 hours for Mini Jam 79: Frogs. Also the limitation was One Level.

In the game you play as a frog. Flies will randomly appear and you have to use your froggy tongue to catch and eat them. The tongue kinda works like a grappling hook. The more flies you catch the more points you get! But bewear of the poison bubble which will damage you if you touch it. Froggo has three lives. If he loses all three you lose :(

But since there was the limitation of "One Level" I also added a level. The level has the player navigating around poison bubbles to reach his lily pad which is the goal.

The game is alright. Its kinda boring, but I like the mechanics.
